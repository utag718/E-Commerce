An e-commerce website built with Django (Python), HTML, CSS, and SQLite as the database can efficiently handle product listings, user accounts, and secure transactions. The Django backend manages product data, user authentication, and order processing, using SQLite to store information about products, customers, orders, and payment details. With HTML and CSS, the website has a responsive and user-friendly interface, allowing customers to browse categories, view product details, add items to their cart, and checkout seamlessly. Additional features like search, filtering, and personalized recommendations can be added to enhance the shopping experience. This setup is scalable and provides a solid foundation for expanding functionalities as the business grows.
